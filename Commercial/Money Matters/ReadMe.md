# Money Matters for the Amstrad CPC

I was requested to convert this program from the BBC model B to the Amstrad CPC.

The software was by Triple R Software and used as education software for very young children.

The games had a keyboard overlay which you attached with velcro tags that had shapes of coinage.

I improved on the BBC Version by adding Digitized Speech and colourful graphics.

The files are provided for historic digital preservation.

The four games 

## Cozmo's Coins
## Piggy Bank
## Fizzy Pop
## Boingy

Were written in a combination of Basic and Assembler.

I was provided with the distribuition copy of the BBC B version on disk and had to work everything out from there.

I don't have the final distribution release as these disks appear to be missing, what I have provided is what remains in my project archive.
