Amstrad CPC Source Code

This repository contains Source Code written by Jason Brooks for the Amstrad CPC6128 Computer.  Source code will vary from 1985 to the early 90's where I moved on to HP System V, sVr3

The repository is for educational purposes and to maintain a digital archive of code that is 30 years old.

Please feel free to examine/modify/fix code as you see fit.

over the years I was involved with conversions and hacking tools on this platform, mainly in assembler.  ADAM (Assembler, Disassembler and Monitor) was my tool of choice as it was fully relocatable, could be loaded into a ram bank on a 6128 and was very capable when hacking and reverse engineering code and protection systems in its day.

I can be contacted at Jason (at) Mucky Paws dot com

2024 - Starting work on Repo to clean up, document and organise the repository
